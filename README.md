## Introduction
Fast Security is the first project of class WU18 where we were assigned to make a landing page for the new vehicle FastSecurity 1.0 (FS1)

We worked alongside the Digital designer and Computer graphics design classes to assemble a finished product

## Build Process
The landing page was made with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.

It is fully responsive and uses a language api that updates the content dynamically depending on the users language preference.
